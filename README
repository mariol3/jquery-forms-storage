Simple jQuery plugin to automate forms storing through
the HTML5 Storage API. 

NOTE:	This is not a pro code. It's just an experiment
		that I made and decided to share with other people
		with this type of problem. Sorry if best pratices
		don't live here! :P

WARNING: 	To work it needs that form elements have at least
			an id or a name.

TODO:
		add a clear method.
